# Concurrent Programming and Distributed Computing projects



\# Projects on Concurrent Programming \& Distributed Computing #



\## Concurrent Programming folder ##

* Folder "Concurrent-Programming-using-C" contains several projects that implement several concurrent programming mechanisms like Semaphores, Mutexes, Synchronization, Critical Code Sections (CSS).
* All of these are implemented in C language from scratch, using Linux P-threads, OpenMP and CUDA.
* The list of projects are the following:
* &nbsp; \* Circular read/write buffer. 1 Thread writes and the other read reads, both asynchronously.
* Â  \* Recursive, concurrent Mandelbrot pattern production.
* &nbsp; \* Recursive Quicksort.





\## Distributed Computing folder ##

* Folder "Distributed-Computing-using-Python" contains several projects that implement fundamental distributed computing mechanisms like 
* These are implemented in C language from scratch basic Concuree which implement distributed computing methodologies from scratch, using Python
* The list of projects are the following:
* &nbsp; Asynchronous Server/Client communication
* &nbsp; Decentralisated (fully distribitued) group communication with Total Order messaging
* &nbsp; Network File System (NFS)
* &nbsp; Remote runtimes that support live code migration and automatic load balancing.
* &nbsp; Multithreaded Parser, Compiler and execution of AT-Command based instructions.
