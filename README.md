# Concurrent Programming and Distributed Computing projects



\# Projects on High Performance Computing (HPC), Concurrent Programming \& Distributed Computing #

\## High Performance Computing (HPC) ##
* Folder "High-Performance-Computing-in-C-language-master" contains projects-experimentations on several techniques & technologies that try to reduce the execution time of a program
* In our case, we experiment on:
  * Single threaded programs with SW & Compiler optimization techniques (Intel's icc compiler & VTune studio for metrics).
  * Multithreaded programs using OpenMP's library for C language.
  * Multithreaded programs using NVIDIA's CUDA library for C language.


\## Concurrent Programming folder ##

* Folder "Concurrent-Programming-using-C" contains several projects that implement several concurrent programming mechanisms like Semaphores, Mutexes, Synchronization, Critical Code Sections (CSS).
* All of these are implemented in C language from scratch, using Linux P-threads, OpenMP and CUDA.
* The list of projects are the following:

&nbsp; \* Circular read/write buffer (one thread writes and one thread reads, both asynchronously).

&nbsp; \* Recursive, concurrent Mandelbrot pattern production.

&nbsp; \* Recursive Quicksort.

&nbsp; \* Multithreaded parsing, error checking and execution of AT-Command based instructions (pseudo script language).





\## Distributed Computing folder ##



* Folder "Distributed-Computing-using-Python" contains several projects that implement fundamental distributed computing mechanisms like 
* These are implemented in C language from scratch basic Concuree which implement distributed computing methodologies from scratch, using Python
* The list of projects are the following:

&nbsp; \* Asynchronous Server/Client communication

&nbsp; \* Decentralisated (fully distribitued) group communication with Total Order messaging

&nbsp; \* Network File System (NFS)

&nbsp; \* Remote runtimes that support live code migration and automatic load balancing.
