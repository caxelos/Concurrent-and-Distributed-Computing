# High Performance, Concurrent and Distributed Computing 

\# Projects on High Performance Computing (HPC), Concurrent Programming \& Distributed Computing #


\## High Performance Computing (HPC) ##
* Folder "High-Performance-Computing-in-C-language-master" contains projects-experimentations on several techniques \& technologies that try to reduce the execution time of a program
* In our case, we experiment on:
1.  	Single threaded programs with SW \& Compiler optimization techniques (Intel's icc compiler \& VTune studio for metrics).
2. 	Multithreaded programs using OpenMP's library for C language.
3.  	Multithreaded programs using NVIDIA's CUDA library for C language.


\## Concurrent Programming folder ##
* Folder "Concurrent-Programming-using-C" contains several projects that implement several concurrent programming mechanisms like Semaphores, Mutexes, Synchronization, Critical Code Sections (CSS).
* All of these are implemented in C language from scratch, using Linux P-threads, OpenMP and CUDA.
* The list of projects are the following:
1. Circular read/write buffer (one thread writes and one thread reads, both asynchronously).
2. Recursive, concurrent Mandelbrot pattern production.
3. Recursive Quicksort.
4. Multithreaded parsing, error checking and execution of AT-Command based instructions (pseudo script language).

\## Distributed Computing folder ##
* Folder "Distributed-Computing-using-Python" contains several projects that implement fundamental distributed computing mechanisms like
* These are implemented in C language from scratch basic Concuree which implement distributed computing methodologies from scratch, using Python
* The list of projects are the following:
1. Asynchronous Server/Client communication
2. Decentralisated (fully distribitued) group communication with Total Order messaging
3. Network File System (NFS)
4. Remote runtimes that support live code migration and automatic load balancing.
