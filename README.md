# Projects on High Performance Computing (HPC), Concurrent Programming \& Distributed Computing #

* Folder **High-Performance-Computing-in-C-language-master** contains projects-experimentations on several techniques \& technologies that try to reduce the execution time of a program. Some of them are:
    - ***Compiler & Optimizations***
    - ***OpenMP & CUDA frameworks***

* Folder **Concurrent-Programming-using-C** contains several projects that implement several concurrent programming mechanisms like:
    - ***Mutexes & Semaphores***
    - ***Sychronization & Critical Code Sections (CSS)***
    - ***Condition Monitors Without Active Waiting***.
* Folder **Distributed-Computing-using-Python** contains projects that implement several fundamental distributed computing mechanisms from scratch like:
    - ***Client/Server communication***.
    - ***Centralized Group Chat Communication***
    - ***Network File System (NFS)***
    - ***Remote Runtime environments with Live Code Migration***
