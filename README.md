# High Performance, Concurrent and Distributed Computing 



\# Projects on High Performance Computing (HPC), Concurrent Programming \& Distributed Computing #



\## High Performance Computing (HPC) ##

* Folder "..." contains projects-experimentations on several techniques \& technologies that try to reduce the execution time of a program
* In our case, we experiment on:
*  	Single threaded programs with SW \& Compiler optimization techniques (Intel's icc compiler \& VTune studio for metrics).
*  	Multithreaded programs using OpenMP's library for C language.
*  	Multithreaded programs using NVIDIA's CUDA library for C language.





\## Concurrent Programming folder ##

* Folder "Concurrent-Programming-using-C" contains several projects that implement several concurrent programming mechanisms like Semaphores, Mutexes, Synchronization, Critical Code Sections (CSS).
* All of these are implemented in C language from scratch, using Linux P-threads, OpenMP and CUDA.
* The list of projects are the following:

  \* Circular read/write buffer (one thread writes and one thread reads, both asynchronously).

  \* Recursive, concurrent Mandelbrot pattern production.

  \* Recursive Quicksort.

  \* Multithreaded parsing, error checking and execution of AT-Command based instructions (pseudo script language).





\## Distributed Computing folder ##



* Folder "Distributed-Computing-using-Python" contains several projects that implement fundamental distributed computing mechanisms like
* These are implemented in C language from scratch basic Concuree which implement distributed computing methodologies from scratch, using Python
* The list of projects are the following:

  \* Asynchronous Server/Client communication

  \* Decentralisated (fully distribitued) group communication with Total Order messaging

  \* Network File System (NFS)

  \* Remote runtimes that support live code migration and automatic load balancing.
