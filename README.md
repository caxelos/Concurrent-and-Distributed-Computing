## High Performance Computing (HPC)
* Folder "High-Performance-Computing-in-C-language-master" contains projects-experimentations on several techniques \& technologies that try to reduce the execution time of a program
* In our case, we experiment on:
    - Single threaded programs with SW \& Compiler optimization techniques (Intel's icc compiler \& VTune studio for metrics).
    - Multithreaded programs using OpenMP's library for C language.
    - Multithreaded programs using NVIDIA's CUDA library for C language.

* Folder "**Concurrent-Programming-using-C**" contains several projects that implement several concurrent programming mechanisms like ***Semaphores, Mutexes, Synchronization, Critical Code Sections (CSS)**.


## Distributed Computing folder ##
* Folder "Distributed-Computing-using-Python" contains projects that implement several fundamental distributed computing mechanisms from scratch,
* Some of the implemented functionalities have to do with:
    - Asynchronous Server/Client communication
    - Decentralisated (fully distribitued) group communication with Total Order messaging
    - Network File System (NFS)
    - Remote runtimes that support live code migration and automatic load balancing.
