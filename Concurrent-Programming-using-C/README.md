* From Technical Perspective, we:
  - Use Pthread library o implement mutexes from scratch.
  - Pthread library to implement "fair binary semaphores" from scratch.
  - Pthread library in order to implement Condition Monitors and wait mechanisms.
  - We also implement a compound project (Compiler Parser), in order to combine and get familiar with these techniques.
