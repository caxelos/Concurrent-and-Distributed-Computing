# Mandelbrot Set Calculation

1. Here's a multithreaded version of Mandelbrot set calculation, using
Pthread library
2. The Mandelbrot set serves as a “map” of how quadratic polynomials behave when iterated in the complex plane. 
3. It "reveals" deep connections between order and chaos in dynamical
systems.
